# Code Refactor Starter Code


## Horiseon
This is a project dedicated to refactoring existing code. The website for Horiseon was functioning perfectly well, but the code required semantic HTML and major reformatting to the structure of the CSS style sheet.
For instance, I replaced multiple div elements with nav, or header, or section. I also consolidated many of the repeating CSS values in the style sheet--images found in the content section all had the same values, so I gave them a class of their own that could be used to consolidate these values into one CSS rule.

## Technologies
In this project, I used both HTML and CSS.
